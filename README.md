## SURI Project in Summer 2024 


This project was sponsored by Swanson School of Engineering. The objective is to integrate demand forecasting into inventory control policy making. An outcome of academic papar abstract was produced.

Literature contains the original codes and paper from reference studies
Detailed content is mentioned in the abstract.

Project contains project code, some of code files were lost, and this study has not been finished because further development for model perfomance robustness is missing.
 1. Forecasting Model is for RNN algorithms forecasting
 2. NonRNN is for other ML algorithms forecasting
 3. Single Simulation is for debugging in simnulation logic because there was an explosion in result numerically due to issues in iteration
 4. Optimal Simulation is for optimal parameters experimenting
 5. Proposed simulation is the unfinished script
